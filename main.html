<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the number of operations it performs as the input size increases. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to enhance performance.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm consumes as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input.</p>
